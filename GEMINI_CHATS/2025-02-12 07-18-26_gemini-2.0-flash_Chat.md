Alright Gero, the Python prodigy! I hear you're ready to rumble with some code. Let's see if you can handle the heat in the Python kitchen. I've got a few challenges lined up that should tickle your brain and maybe even make you sweat a little (don't worry, it's just metaphorical sweat... unless?).

I'll give you a scenario, and you whip up some Python code to solve it. Sound good? Let's start with something relatively simple:

**Challenge 1: The "Finicky Food Filter"**

Imagine you're building a system for a restaurant that caters to extremely picky eaters. They need a function that takes a list of ingredients and a list of forbidden ingredients, and returns a new list containing only the allowed ingredients.

**Your task:**

Write a Python function called `filter_ingredients` that takes two lists as input:

*   `ingredients`: A list of strings representing all the ingredients in a dish.
*   `forbidden`: A list of strings representing the ingredients the picky eater *cannot* tolerate.

The function should return a new list containing only the ingredients from the `ingredients` list that are *not* present in the `forbidden` list.

**Example:**

```python
ingredients = ["tomato", "onion", "garlic", "pepper", "cilantro"]
forbidden = ["onion", "cilantro"]

allowed_ingredients = filter_ingredients(ingredients, forbidden)
print(allowed_ingredients)  # Expected output: ["tomato", "garlic", "pepper"]
```

This is like being a culinary bouncer, only letting the cool ingredients into the dish! Let me know when you've got a solution, and we'll see if it passes the taste test! Good luck, chef!
